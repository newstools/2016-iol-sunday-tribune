Former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu would rather stay at home and &#x201C;go hungry&#x201D; than accept deployment to the National Assembly.In a open interview, he said that his departure in May had been with mixed feelings. He resigned after pressure from the ANC national working committee and has been unemployed since.Personal life&#x201C;I had to explain to my family that there would no longer be an income and I had to think of things I could do to survive. People still think I am in government and they approach me from time to time to share my views about government-related issues.&#x201D;Mchunu was with his wife, Thembeka, the former mayor of uThungulu District Municipality. She did not make re-election and is also unemployed.Mchunu said the upside of not being the premier was that he spent more &#x201C;meaningful&#x201D; time with his ailing mother.&#x201C;Being unemployed has afforded me time I rarely had to spend with my family. I eat breakfast, lunch and supper with them. I even get to choose the meal for the day,&#x201D; he chuckled.Portrayed as a failureMchunu said he would rather stay at home and be hungry than accept deployment to the National Assembly because the provincial executive committee had portrayed him as a failure.He said the decisions taken by leaders must be accompanied by legitimacy. He said he was not bitter about being removed as premier but the reason for his removal could not be substantiated.Mchunu said one of the allegations that were levelled by the provincial leaders was that he was failing to run the province.How could he be &#x201C;found guilty&#x201D; and then nominated to a position as serious as the National Assembly, he asked. &#x201C;It was a contradiction and my conscience would not allow me to accept such deployment. I have integrity,&#x201D; he said.The problem arose, Mchunu said, when the national leadership did not grant him the opportunity to defend himself.&#x201C;As young cadres growing up in student politics, we knew the ANC as the party that sought justice, which is in-built in the party. Hearing the other side has always been procedure,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But there was no other side in my case&#x201D;.He said the ANC must get its house in order or else it will &#x201C;fall sooner than people think&#x201D;.Mchunu said the shift from core values was a recipe for disaster.Divisions in KZN&#x201C;We are divided, that I am forthright on,&#x201D; he said.He said the divisions started in December 2012 and intensified in 2013. It was the period in which his predecessor, Zweli Mkhize, had been elected national treasurer-general in Mangaung, North West.Mkhize had to relinquish his position as premier to take up the full-time post at Luthuli House, the party&#x2019; headquarters in Gauteng.It was a defining moment in the province that saw comrade turn against comrade over the candidate to replace Mkhize. Mchunu emerged victorious over current Premier Willies Mchunu.At the time, it was claimed that the result was against the will of President Jacob Zuma and Mkhize because Mchunu was linked to the &#x201C;forces of change&#x201D; group, which was pushing for then Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe to replace Zuma as ANC president in Mangaung. Motlanthe lost. Mchunu distanced himself from the group.The face of the ANC was beginning to change, he said. &#x201C;The ANC cannot survive without internal democracy. Values and truth are the commodities that are waning in the ruling party,&#x201D; he said.He described the ANC as a &#x201C;national heritage&#x201D;, but said that the values that had seen the party through 104 years had been eroded.The party was now being run like a company with directors. But the status of being a national treasure was diminishing. &#x201C;We are now dealers,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;The ANC is run like it belongs to a particular elite,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Some people were making deals in the organisation,&#x201D; he added.He described the ANC generation of the 1940s, 50s and 60s as a &#x201C;generation of immortals&#x201D;.&#x201C;They came to the organisation not for their stomachs,&#x201D; he said.State enterprisesMchunu voiced concerns about the condition of state-owned enterprises.About Eskom, he said it was &#x201C;abnormal&#x201D; that people were lauding the power utility for keeping the lights on after load shedding. &#x201C;That was what the power grid should do&#x201D;.Court case A group of ANC members opened a case in July in a bid to nullify last year&#x2019; elective conference. Asked if he supported the move, he said, &#x201C;We are all affected by the case. I&#x2019;m sure those who opened the case would have considered the consequences.&#x201D; Sunday Tribune IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
