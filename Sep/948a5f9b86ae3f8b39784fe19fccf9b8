Durban - The dominance of the Zulus in South African life was evident yesterday when the whole country was supposed to be celebrating Heritage Day, but the Zulu component of the population took centre stage.It resulted in President Jacob Zuma, a proud Zulu, delegating the responsibility of giving the main address of Heritage Day at Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley to his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma was at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban to attend an uMkhosi weLembe (Shaka&#x2019;s Day) celebration that marked 200 years since King Shaka founded the mighty Zulu kingdom.The momentous occasion, which coincided with Heritage Day, also marked the 45-year reign of the incumbent monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini. Thousands of Zulu regiments, traditional dance groups, the Nazareth Baptist Church faithful, continental monarchs and dignitaries, converged on the venue. It was the first time that the event had been held in Durban. It was previously hosted in KwaDukuza on the North Coast, where the Zulu founder was buried. Sunday Tribune
