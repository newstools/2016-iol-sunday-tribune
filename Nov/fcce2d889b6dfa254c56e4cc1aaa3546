Durban - The University of KwaZulu-Natal student who faked his matric results to get into medical school is looking forward to becoming a doctor after charges against him were withdrawn in the Durban Magistrate&#x2019;s Court on Friday.Westville resident Rivaaz Manisunker, 24, was let off the hook on the basis that the whistle-blower in the case &#x201C;feared for their life&#x201D; and did not want to testify in court.State prosecutor Nozuko Mzulwini had no option but to withdraw the charges. One of the other contributing factors was that UKZN was not a complainant.Magistrate Mondli Nhlangulela took the decision to drop the charges despite Manisunker&#x2019;s confession in affidavits that he had doctored his results to secure a highly-contested place at the medical school.Manisunker obtained 34 percent for maths in Grade 12 and his overall average was well below the 90 percent required for Indian students to get into medical school. In his doctored certificate, his marks were adjusted to meet the requirements.A whistle-blower who learnt of his actions approached the police but did not want to testify in court.Manisunker&#x2019;s attorney Rajesh Hiralall objected to this and made a formal application to the senior prosecutor to have the charges withdrawn.Manisunker admitted to doctoring his results and pleaded for leniency in his application.&#x201C;I am not a rapist or a murderer. I did nothing wrong. There are far more serious offenders. I am remorseful for my actions and I did what I did for the betterment of society. I am passionate about medicine and I am an intelligent pupil who excelled in my Grade 11 year. Due to tragic circumstances, I was unable to perform well in my final year,&#x201D; Manisunker said outside court on Friday.He attended Wingen Heights Secondary school for only 33 days in his matric year due to an illness, but said he still managed to pass.In his affidavit, Manisunker claimed a number of factors influenced his poor results including deaths in his family and his parents&#x2019; acrimonious divorce.Hiralall said his client wished to continue his studies to fulfil his dream of becoming a doctor. He has already started writing his fourth year exams.Manisunker&#x2019;s story emerged amid allegations of bribery to secure places at the medical school.He denied paying a bribe to secure his place but said he was well aware of the syndicate accepting bribes at the medical school and would help the university to further their investigation.&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know why I am the only one being targeted when there are others at the medical school who are not supposed to be there and who got in fraudulently.&#x201D;He claimed to have been a pawn in a &#x201C;personal vendetta&#x201D; and said his family had become victims, receiving threats to their lives since his court appearances.&#x201C;I am a peaceful person and all I want is to fulfil my passion,&#x201D; said Manisunker.UKZN spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said the university would take action against any student found to have misrepresented their credentials to gain admission.&#x201C;The university proctor is in the process of instituting disciplinary action against the student. Any action taken against the student will depend on the outcome of the disciplinary process. The university has provided all information and documentation that was requested by the police,&#x201D; said Seshoka.Seshoka said forensic auditors KPMG, who had been appointed to look into the bribery allegations, were concluding their report and it would be released in due course.
