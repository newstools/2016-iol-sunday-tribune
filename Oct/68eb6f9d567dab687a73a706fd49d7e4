Fight over cost of funeral for Don MkhwanaziSiphelele ButheleziDON Mkhwanazi&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s brother is angry that the late businessman&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s name is being used to settle political scores.Xolani Mkhwanazi said the family was tired of the reports of a donation given to them for the funeral in July.Mkhwanazi died of a heart attack, aged 63.&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;We never asked anyone for money. Political parties are just fighting to use our name. We have nothing to do with their arguments. We are grieving and want to be left alone,&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; Xolani said.The eThekwini Municipality reportedly spent more than R761&#xC2;&#xA0;000 on the funeral of the businessman, which did not sit well with opposition parties.They asked how such an amount could be spent on Mkhwanazi when people who required financial assistance were given less.The DA also alleged that the amount had not been paid to the ICC as the venue had been &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;donated&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;. They challenged the municipality to break down the spending.Mkhwanazi&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s wife, Zodwa Msimang, who is a board member of the ICC, said she had not been part of the funeral organising committee.Don Mkhwanazi.
