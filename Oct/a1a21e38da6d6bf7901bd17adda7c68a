The ANC has called on Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to urgently fire the SABC board to allow for the appointment of an interim board.This follows the defiance of the SABC board this week after it was told by Parliament it should pack and go.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said on Saturday that Muthambi must suspend the board without any waste of time.Muthambi&#x2019;s spokesman, Mish Molakeng, did not respond to messages sent to him.Kodwa confirmed that the ANC had not decided on the names of people to serve on the interim board after the current board had been dissolved. He said it was a matter of urgent priority that the SABC board must go now before it further damages the credibility of the public broadcaster.He said the events of this week in Parliament and outside sent a clear message the issue of dissolving the board may take time, so it was urgent that Muthambi suspend it.&#x201C;Our view is that the minister should consider firing the remaining four members of the board. The current board is in limbo, it cannot take any binding decisions,&#x201D; he said.He said the ANC was now going to take a firm stance against dysfunctional boards of state-owned companies (SOEs) that took irrational decisions. The time for the boards of SOEs to do as they liked had come to an end, he warned.The games played by the SABC board have to come to a stop as a matter of urgency. He said the current SABC Board, chaired by Mbulaheni Maguvhe, had done more damage to the SABC by staying on.Chairman of the portfolio committee on communications Humphrey Maxegwana said yesterday he had written to the Speaker, Baleka Mbete, for an inquiry into the fitness of the board to hold office.Political Bureau
