Durban - The Durban baby who couldn&#x2019;t be touched because of a rare skin condition died in the arms of his grandmother this week after succumbing to his ailment.Eighteen-month-old Abubakr Akbar of Verulam, north of Durban, was diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa, a skin disease so rare it affects 1 in 50 000.It is a severe, genetic skin-blistering condition, for which there is no cure. It is described by some medical experts as &#x201C;the worst thing you can live with&#x201D;.The condition causes the skin to blister even with the slightest touch and ranges from mild to severe. Abubakr&#x2019;s condition was severe.He was the first child of Nazmeera, 26, and Arshad, 29.When his blisters burst, it would leave the skin exposed and would sometimes cause it to bleed.He wore special clothing and nappies and could only be bathed once in three days to avoid blistering.Arshad said on Saturday that he and Nazmeera were devastated at their baby&#x2019;s death.&#x201C;He became very sick and his wounds were not healing. He spent five days at King Edward Hospital, but still he was not healing. He passed away on Wednesday in his grandmother&#x2019;s arms.&#x201D;Nazmeera&#x2019;s brother died of the same condition as a baby.&#x201C;Abubakr was our first baby and we are now afraid to have another child because we fear our next baby will be born with the same condition,&#x201D; he said.Durban dermatologist Rajendra Singh said he had seen about 20 such cases during his career.&#x201C;Such a disease can be due to genetics or environmental conditions.&#x201C;Those who have a simpler form of the disease can lead fairly normal lives, but if it is severe, it becomes life-threatening. Most people die due to infections caused from open wounds,&#x201D; said Singh.Abubakr was buried on Thursday. [email&#160;protected] Sunday Tribune IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
