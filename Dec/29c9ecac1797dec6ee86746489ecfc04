Perumal Gounden, of Dangelo Place, said he had tried for years to get council to address the matter, and since earlier this year, dumping on the property had become a real concern. The city is dragging its feet in taking a stance on the homeowner,&quot; he said. &quot;The lack of maintenance has contributed to security and health hazards and little is being done by the municipality to get it cleaned up. &quot;It has now made our area look unappealing, and will devalue our properties and cause storm water issues if dumping continues.&quot; Gounden said people visited the site to dump plastic chairs, rubble and other hazardous waste, a major concern. When we ask the workers why they are dumping, they say that they are just following orders from the owner. Gounden said that it was high time the municipality took action against the landowner by enforcing fines. His son, Kamalen, who is a town planner, said that it was a contravention of city by-laws. The municipality needs to clear the rubble and make sure that the owner complies,&quot; he said.&quot;If it is not controlled now, we will be subjected to other problems in the future. Sunday Tribune
