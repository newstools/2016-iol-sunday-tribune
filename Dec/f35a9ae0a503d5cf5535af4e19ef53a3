Durban - KwaZulu-Natal s provincial police commissioner will return to work after acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane failed in his bid to keep her out of office. Durban High Court judge Nkosinathi Chili dismissed an application to appeal his earlier judgment overturning Phahlane s decision to suspend Lieutenant-General Mmamonnye Ngobeni. Ngobeni has been accused of getting businessman Thoshan Panday to pay for her husband s lavish birthday party and ordering the head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal to stop investigating Panday's involvement in a R60 million police accommodation tender. Ngobeni said she paid Panday back and denied interfering with the investigation.Sunday Tribune
