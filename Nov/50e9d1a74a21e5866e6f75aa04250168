Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma is set to emerge unscathed from Monday&#x2019;s national working committee meeting where the issue of state capture will be discussed.This will be the second scandal Zuma will survive after the Nkandla fallout that rippled across the ANC, the alliance and society. Zuma&#x2019;s supporters have already come out in his defence.But the NEC meeting at the end of November could lead to more divisions in the ANC after Zuma&#x2019;s opponents warned after Nkandla that there should not be another scandal that will damage the ANC.Two NEC members said on Saturday the state capture report was a serious issue that would be interrogated at the NEC meeting.But the NWC on Monday would indicate whether the issue of state capture would receive special attention or be discussed at the scheduled meeting in November.The NWC could decide that the NEC hold a special meeting to discuss state capture or leave it for the scheduled meeting at the end of the month.ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe has already indicated that Zuma is not going anywhere.Mantashe told ANC members in Peddie, Eastern Cape, that it would be self-defeating to remove Zuma now.This was because Zuma was close to finishing his term in office.Mantashe has previously warned that the recall of former President Thabo Mbeki tore the ANC apart.He said the ANC had learnt painful lessons from the Mbeki recall, which left the ANC more divided.Earlier ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the agenda of the NWC would be known when it sat on Monday.Zuma&#x2019;s supporters in the ANC have spoken strongly in his defence and blasted former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela for her report.The ANC Youth League, the ANC Women&#x2019;s League and uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association said the report was one-sided and was designed to nail Zuma and others implicated.They have called for a full-scale investigation into state capture including white monopoly capital.MKMVA chairman Kebby Maphatsoe said Zuma had support from branches following consultations done by the ANC after the poor showing in the municipal polls in August.Maphatsoe said the ANC branches had backed Zuma to finish his term. Zuma&#x2019;s term as head of state ends in 2019, and he has just over a year left before he completes his term as ANC President.The ANC has not officially opened the succession debate but Zuma supporters have already picked AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to succeed him. But those opposed to Zuma want Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over.Some of the unions in Cosatu have already expressed their support for Ramaphosa to take over in 2017 and subsequently run the country two years later. But the NWC meeting on Monday is not expected to rein in Zuma or call for him to step down.Zuma supporters have already come out in the president&#x2019;s defence.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
