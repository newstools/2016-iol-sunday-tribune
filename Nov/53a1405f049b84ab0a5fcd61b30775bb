Durban - It&#x2019;s every local rugby player&#x2019;s dream to don the famous green and gold of the Springboks, but to captain the team is an even greater achievement.Pat Lambie made his debut as the skipper of the Boks when his charges engaged the Barbarians in a match at London&#x2019;s Wembley Stadium on Saturday.And Lambie&#x2019;s family were on the sidelines, in full voice, supporting the gifted flyhalf, even though the encounter was not recorded as an official Test match.Lambie, 26, who is a part of the Springbok&#x2019;s leadership group, filled in for regular captain Adriaan Strauss, who was not considered for the clash.Among the dedicated supporters who trekked to London hoping the Lambie-led team would slaughter the Barbarians were his father Ian, mother Caz, wife Kate and older brother Nic.After all, they had never missed one of his matches, said Ian.The father said he regarded the captaincy as one of his son&#x2019;s biggest rugby achievements and a proud moment for the family.&#x201C;It is the ultimate honour for any sportsman to captain his national team.&#x201D;He said his son was a passionate and competent sportsman.&#x201C;He was always active - never without a bat or ball in his hands - and always surrounded by friends.&#x201C;Patrick is a kind and a gentle person who always put others&#x2019; needs first.&#x201C;And although he was softly spoken, he showed leadership qualities from a young age,&#x201D; said Ian.Lambie could have pursued a career in cricket, said Ian. &#x201C;He had far more successes playing provincial cricket earlier than rugby.&#x201D;Lambie captained both the KZN schools cricket and rugby in his matric year.Ian suggested excellence on the sportsfield ran in the Lambie bloodline.In his heyday, Ian played rugby for Berea Rovers and Natal, but was quick to add his son was a better player than he was.&#x201C;I played in the first team at school (Michaelhouse), then for Berea Rovers for a number of years (mostly as fullback) and was lucky enough to get a handful of games with Natal.&#x201C;But a knee injury ended my playing days. Pat hasn&#x2019;t followed in my footsteps; rather, he has raced far ahead of my achievements.&#x201D;Given the &#x201C;rough and tough&#x201D; nature of rugby, Ian accepts injury as an intrinsic part of the game, and says his son had been in the &#x201C;wars&#x201D; for much of the 2016 season.The versatile Lambie, who is known for his silky ball handling skills and elusive running ability, suffered concussion after a clash in a match against Ireland in June.The injury kept him on the sidelines for a lengthy period.Ian said that in spite of that setback, his son had shown incredible strength of character, which was heartening for the family.&#x201C;As parents, it&#x2019;s your worst nightmare seeing your child get badly injured.&#x201C;Perhaps any sportsman&#x2019;s greatest challenge lies in dealing with injury and the usually long road to recovery, which is as much mental as it is physical,&#x201D; he said.Ian said that away from the rugby field, his son spent time with his family and their dog on the beach, enjoyed a braai or relaxed with a round of golf.
