Durban - They posed as policemen wanting to extort money from motorists, even though one of them needed a &#x201C;crash-course&#x201D; on how to shoot a victim who didn&#x2019;t pay a big enough bribe. And now they are behind bars.Muhammad Shaik, 30, and Navin Ramdhani, 40, confessed before Durban Regional Court Magistrate Fariedha Mohamed this week.Ramdhani taught Shaik how to use a gun just before he shot motorist Rishan Pather of Chatsworth, on July 29.Magistrate Mohamed sentenced Shaik to 12 years in jail, while Ramdhani was handed a 10-year prison term for his involvement in the shooting.After being shot, Pather managed to use his cellphone and call his brother.&#x201C;I am dying. I have been shot. I was hijacked in Shallcross,&#x201D; was the desperate plea for assistance Pather made.He was found with the help of the police, and had lengthy hospital stays, including five days in intensive care.Shaik and Ramdhani were eventually arrested in September by detectives SM &#x201C;Jomo&#x201D; Govender, Rajan Govender and Budgie Nagesar, members of the provincial task team.The charges included robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder, kidnapping and impersonating a police officer.Shaik faced an additional charge of possessing an unlicensed firearm.Pather became emotional as he told the court on Thursday about how the injuries affected his life, and the trauma he had endured after his encounter with Shaik and Ramdhani.Some relatives of the accused, in the gallery, sobbed loudly and the defence lawyers were also moved by the 29-year-old Pather&#x2019;s testimony.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not myself. I&#x2019;m afraid to be alone and I can&#x2019;t be in public anymore. I have constant flashbacks.&#x201D;Attorney Samlal Garbaran, who represented Shaik and Ramdhini&#x2019;s representative, attorney Donald Somo declined to question Pather. Both tendered apologies on behalf of their clients.Earlier, Garbaran read out his client&#x2019;s confession in court.Shaik confessed that he and Ramdhani had been drinking that night.They planned to impersonate police officers and positioned themselves near a drug den in Shallcross.The unmarried Shaik assumed the rank of constable because he was younger and Ramdhani pretended to be a captain.&#x201C;We would search motorists who were seen exiting the den, and their cars, .&#x201C;If we found drugs or they were under the influence of alcohol, we would extort a bribe from them,&#x201D; Shaik said.Pather was one such motorist who got flagged down.Shaik, who was wearing civilian clothing, had on an unmarked bulletproof vest and a SAPS reflective jacket, which belonged to Ramdhani, when he approached Pather.Ramdhani, who sat in his Golf 5, had been a police reservist.Pather paid a R150 bribe to Shaik, who threatened to arrest him for drunk driving.More money was demanded from Pather.His car was then driven by Shaik to a nearby ATM, where Pather withdrew R500 and handed it to the accused.Ramdhani then led the way, in his vehicle, to an isolated area in Savannah Park, and was followed by Shaik who continued to drive Pather&#x2019;s car.The bogus policemen were not satisfied with the money (R650) they had extorted, and decided to shoot their victim with Ramdhani&#x2019;s unlicensed firearm, and sell his car.&#x201C;I shot him (Pather) three times. I&#x2019;m not sure where I shot him as I turned away when I fired. Pather fell to the ground,&#x201D; Shaik said.The bullets struck Pather in his face, stomach and thighs.Ramdhani and Shaik fled the scene with Pather&#x2019;s car, thinking he was dead.Pather&#x2019;s car was then sold to a man in Chatsworth.&#x201C;At home I could not sleep thinking of what I had done. This affected me terribly as I began to digest what had happened.&#x201D;Shaik said he regretted what he had done and wanted to confess to the police, but he was afraid.Ramdhani&#x2019;s confession, which was read out by Somo, corroborated Shaik&#x2019;s version of events.He confirmed that he had given Shaik a crash course ion how to use the firearm.Ramdhani, a father of three, said that they had been promised money from the person who bought Pather&#x2019;s car, but never received any cash.And he also wanted to approach the police about making a confession, but was afraid.State prosecutor Nkosingiphile Manqele asked the minimum sentences be imposed for the crimes committed by Ramdhani and Shaik.In handing the sentences, Magistrate Mohamed said she took into account that Pather had been affected in a &#x201C;bad way&#x201D;, the seriousness of the crimes committed and that similar crimes were rife in the Chatsworth area.She also told the accused that they had &#x201C;absolutely no reason to kidnap or kill Pather&#x201D;.However, Mohamed said she also considered that both of the accused were remorseful, co-operated with police upon arrest and pleaded guilty to the charges they faced.
