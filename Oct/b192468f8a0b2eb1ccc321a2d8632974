Durban - Anti-apartheid activist Mewa Ramgobin will be laid to rest on Sunday. It was announced by President Jacob Zuma on Friday that he would receive a provincial funeral. The national flag at all flag stations in KwaZulu-Natal will be flown at half mast.Zuma extended his condolences on the passing of the former United Democratic Front leader, ANC member of Parliament, struggle stalwart and author who passed away this week.He would have turned 84 next month. Ramgobin was at the forefront of the revival, in 1984, of the Natal Indian Congress (NIC), originally founded by Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi, to unite South Africans of Indian origin against increasingly anti-Indian legislation and later led struggles against apartheid. The country has lost one of its instrumental human rights and political activists in the past decade who dedicated a great deal of his life to the struggle for liberation and fiercely fought racial discrimination. We wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Ramgobin family and may his soul rest in peace, said Zuma said.The funeral will take place at the Mountview Civic Centre in Verulam.
