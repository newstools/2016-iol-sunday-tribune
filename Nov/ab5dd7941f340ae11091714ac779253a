Durban - Recently retired Constitutional Court chief justice Dikgang Moseneke has again called for a review of the constitution.Speaking during the Xubera Institute for Research and Development-organised launch of his book in Durban on Friday, Moseneke, who helped draft the country&#x2019;s interim constitution, said the powers constitutionally vested in the executive did not augur well for the country.&#x201C;Too much power was given to the executive by the constitution. This has affected service provision because it has provided a chance for those in charge to be corrupt,&#x201D; he said.Moseneke said apartheid and colonialism had broken down many black families. He had wanted to be a doctor because he was getting As and Bs in maths and physics.&#x201C;I marvelled at doctors owning big houses and beautiful big cars and gorgeous looking wives. But when I was in jail I enrolled for law subjects through distance learning.&#x201D;Moseneke said he had been the youngest political prisoner at the age of 15. He&#x2019;d joined a 14-day hunger strike with Harry Gwala.The former Robben Island prisoner and current PAC deputy president was fielding a range of questions at the launch of My Own Liberator: A Memoir at the International Convention Centre, also attended by Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe.Radebe said the book challenged leaders to reflect on the road they had travelled. He said it was an inspiring story of a boy who grew up in Atteridgeville, Pretoria, to become a great legal mind.&#x201C;This is a story of struggle against adversity and story of love.&#x201D;On the #FeesMustFall campaign, Radebe said the government had opened its doors and there was no need for violence.&#x201C;We have books in law libraries which were turned into ashes - what are the youth going to learn?&#x201D;Legal and constitutional commentators agreed it was time the constitution was reviewed.Unisa-based public international law, law reform, constitutional law and jurisprudence expert Shadrack Gutto said: &#x201C;It (the remark) is nothing new. Many have previously indicated that the presidency has too much power given to it by the executive, thus a thorough review of the executive, judiciary and Parliament is needed, more so because Parliament has, in effect, become a rubber stamp.Weight&#x201C;This is a very important message coming from someone who is not only a law man, but also who has struggle credentials - the source of the message gives it more weight.&#x201D;He added unfettered powers had resulted in the abuse of power, waste of money and corruption on the watch of an unscrupulous administration.Durban former anti-apartheid activist and former Constitutional Court Justice Zac Yacoob agreed with Gutto. &#x201C;The real problem is that in terms of the constitution, you only need, say 51&#xC2;percent of the vote to prevail in decision-making.&#x201C;Another problem is that people always vote according to party wishes and not conscience.&#x201D;He said the problem did not lie so much with the ANC because the dispensation favoured the ruling party, meaning if the opposition won the election it would also take advantage of the constitution.
