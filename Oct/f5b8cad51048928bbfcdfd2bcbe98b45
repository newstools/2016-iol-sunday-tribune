By Clinton MoodleyDurban - Thousands of Hindus filled the streets of Durban central with colour as they marched towards the old drive-in site as part of the Durban Diwali Festival float procession. Devotees marched through the streets singing religious hymns and dancing in their vibrant Indian attire. It was so infectious that bystanders who were videoing the procession started dancing along.More than 55 cars and floats took part, making it one of the biggest according to organiser Neeran Besesar. About 300 000 guests are expected to attend the festival over the weekend.Last night the skies were filled with flashing lights and bursting colour from the fireworks display. Besesar said they were overwhelmed by the response at this year s event and was glad it encompassed the theme of Racism Stops with Me - Vasudaivam Kutumbakam (the world is one family).He said the only hiccup was that the procession clashed with the Albinism Awareness Walk. He said they had applied for approval in February. We are grateful that it ran smoothly and both parades took place. There is still lots for people to do at the festival with shopping, food and an entertainment line-up for the entire family, he said. Today the Hawan ceremony will take place. This auspicious event will unite the Hindu community in prayer, featuring 108 hawan kunds (small steel containers where an offering is made) and priests from all linguistic groups. Children can enjoy special cultural programmes and a kiddie s corner. clinton.moodley@inl.co.zaSunday Tribune
