Durban - Nonsense. That is how Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan described claims that his reappointment in December resulted from his ties with white monopoly capital.He was speaking via a recorded video message during the memorial lecture of struggle activist Billy Nair. He couldn&#x2019;t attend the event because he was not well.Gordhan, an ANC national executive committee member, said ANC leaders decided on his reappointment. President Jacob Zuma subsequently offered him the job, he accepted and succeeded Des van Rooyen, who was in the post for four days.Gordhan told a packed oThongathi town hall on Friday night his speech would be personal.&#x201C;This nonsense about monopoly capital and so on is just that, nonsense. We serve in the treasury to serve the national interest. My position required working with the poorest and not so poor of this country,&#x201D; he said.Without naming anyone, he warned against those perpetuating such claims, saying &#x201C;people will catch up with you. People are not fools anymore. They have woken up now.&#x201D;During a Hands Off President Zuma march in Durban recently, ANC Youth League president Collen Maine accused Gordhan of serving the interests of &#x201C;white monopoly capital&#x201D;.Maine said Gordhan did not represent the poor and was advancing the interest of his &#x201C;handlers&#x201D;.This view also seems to be held by former government spokesman and leader of the Decolonisation Foundation, Mzwanele &#x201C;Jimmy&#x201D; Manyi and Black First, Land First leader Andile Mgxitama.Both have called for investigations into Gordhan and his predecessors, Nhlanhla Nene and Trevor Manuel.Gordhan was speaking publicly for the first time since the dropping of fraud charges against him this week. He had been charged along with Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula, all former SA Revenue Service (Sars) officials.The charges by the National Prosecuting Authority stemmed from Pillay&apos;s early retirement with full benefits having been authorised by Magashula and approved by Gordhan.Gordhan said the charges were politically motivated and would not stand up in court. He thanked those who rallied behind them.&#x201C;We thank all of you who have been active, and correctly so in the recent past. I would like to commend you for the activism we have seen recently.&#x201D;On Friday he wrote a &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; letter for the support he was given. The letter was posted on the Treasury&#x2019;s website.He also lauded his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, saying he was a man of integrity. &#x201C;He said you can keep your R600 000 and I&apos;ll keep my integrity. If anybody gives you R600 000 you must refuse it,&#x201D; he said.Jonas told former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela during her investigation into state capture that the Gupta family, with whom Zuma has been closely associated, offered him R600 000 if he took up the post of finance minister.&#x201C;Nair belonged to a band that was incorruptible, even by people who had R600 000,&#x201D; he said to loud cheers.Despite the ANC being mired in controversy, Gordhan said it was not all doom and gloom, &#x201C;because the ANC and the country have a lot of capable leaders&#x201D;.Meanwhile, the Active Citizens Movement, comprising staunch supporters of Gordhan and former United Democratic Front stalwarts, is calling for President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s head.The movement urged democrats in the ANC to stop shielding Zuma and vote him out of power.The Merebank Justice Network, which raised funds for Gordhan&#x2019;s legal fees, said it would persist with its efforts in case charges were reinstated.&#x201C;Injustice must be fought and those responsible must be exposed,&#x201D; said Gordhan.Former health and public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan also attended the meeting.Ahmed Kathrada was honoured during the event for his role during the struggle against apartheid, while former cabinet minister Jay Naidoo also addressed the crowd.
