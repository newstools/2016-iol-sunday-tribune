A group of Catholic priests who prompted former public protector Thuli Madonsela to investigate the allegations of &#x201C;state capture&#x201D; against the Gupta family, President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s allies, have welcomed her report.The men of cloth were, however, still studying the 350-page report to form a &#x201C;sound&#x201D; opinion and decide on the way forward.Father Brian Mhlanga, spokesperson for the Dominican Order of Southern Africa, said: &#x201C;We pay homage to the court for ordering the release of the report.&#x201D;Mhlanga and Father Stanislaus Muyebe, the order&apos;s vicar-general, are first complainants, with DA leader Mmusi Maimane being the second.At the core of their concerns are the &#x201C;serious allegations&#x201D; made against the Gupta family of meddling in state matters, Mhlanga said. Zuma was also implicated in the report.&#x201C;I think it&apos;s proper that those allegations should be investigated independently because they might, or will, have serious implications for the country.&#x201C;We&apos;re very happy with the performance of the court and Chapter 9 institutions because in some way they have restored some public confidence,&#x201D; he said.Mhlanga emphasised they were representing the underprivileged, who &#x201C;lived hand to mouth&#x201D;. He said they were non-partisan and wouldn&apos;t want to be drawn in political matters.He lauded the justice system, saying: &#x201C;It shows that there are elements of checks and balances in those institutions.The Dominican Order of Southern Africa is a body of Catholic priests from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and the island of St Helena.The priests wrote to Madonsela in March after the reports surfaced that the Gupta family were pulling the strings behind the scenes in the appointment of cabinet ministers.At the time, Deputy Minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas fuelled those allegations after he admitted on national TV that he was offered the finance minister&apos;s post by the Guptas. Jonas turned down the offer.Independent Media
