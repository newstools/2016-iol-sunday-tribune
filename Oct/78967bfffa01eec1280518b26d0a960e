Police Minister Nathi Nhleko&#x2019;s row with Speaker Baleka Mbete may blow up in his face as he awaits the outcome of his failure to report the appointment of Mthandazo Ntlemeza as Hawks head.Nhleko fired an unprecedented broadside at the legislature, the ANC study group and Mbete, in particular, this week as he watched the return of Robert McBride to his post as head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.Still licking his wounds from defeat in the Constitutional Court, which last month set aside his decision to launch a disciplinary hearing against McBride and to suspend him pending the outcome, Nhleko accused Mbete of &#x201C;behaviour which negates the severity of this matter&#x201D;.He complained that his request for Parliament to begin a disciplinary process in place of his own had been ignored by Mbete until last week, despite the fact that he had written to the Speaker a day after the judgment on September 6, asking for the matter to be expedited as he and the legislature had been given just 30 days before McBride&#x2019;s suspension would automatically lapse.Mbete, in her letter to the minister last week, explained that she had obtained legal opinion which made it clear the process the minister was asking for could be initiated only by way of a resolution of the National Assembly.Now his attack on Mbete and Parliament has drawn in Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the Leader of Government Business, whom Mbete said she would approach &#x201C;as a matter of urgency&#x201D; after what she termed the minister&#x2019;s &#x201C;unprecedented, unwarranted and unfortunate&#x201D; comments.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu waded in, saying the minister&#x2019;s comments had &#x201C;cast aspersions on the Speaker of the National Assembly and reflects disrespectfully against Parliament as an institution&#x201D;.He expressed his full support for Mbete&#x2019;s handling of the matter.&#x201C;The minister&#x2019;s posture and tone, including certain inferences he made against ANC caucus internal structures, were unnecessary and unwarranted,&#x201D; Mthembu said.Nhleko, who is not even a member of the ANC&#x2019;s national executive committee, now finds himself pitted against two members of its top six, in Mbete and Ramaphosa, and the ANC caucus, even as he awaits Parliament&#x2019;s condonation of his bungled appointment of Ntlemeza - whose persecution of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, among others, has made him a highly divisive figure in the governing party.Getting Parliament to overlook his failure to report to it within the specified 14 days on Ntlemeza&#x2019;s appointment is not going to be the cakewalk he may have enjoyed in the past.He faces the hurdle of a divided ANC caucus whose reflections on past missteps, especially relating to its mindless adoption of his report on Nkandla, have led it to adopt a more combative posture not only towards the executive but also the parliamentary process itself.As he has discovered in the McBride matter, it is no longer a question of a minister telling the legislature when and how high to jump.House chairman Cedric Frolick told Independent Newspapers that while Nhleko &#x201C;seems to have thought Parliament should simply proceed&#x201D; with the McBride inquiry, there was a substantial consultation process required before a resolution could even be put to the National Assembly.It had first to be drafted by the table staff on the basis of legal advice, then submitted to the multi-party chief whips&#x2019; forum, where it would be discussed and often amended, before it would go to the programming committee to be placed on the order paper.Then it would be proposed in the name of the majority party chief whip and, if there were objections and a division was called, debated and voted upon.&#x201C;Of course, if you want to deal with such an important issue in a proper way, you must ensure that due process takes place and not try to skip any of the established processes of consultation in Parliament,&#x201D; Frolick said.He said Nhleko&#x2019;s request for Parliament to condone the Ntlemeza appointment process was being considered by Mbete, who was receiving legal advice on how to proceed.However, it would have to go through the same consultations.&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve also learnt from past and recent experiences that it&#x2019;s better to ensure that we deal with matters according to the established rules of Parliament, especially issues that are in the public domain, where people have a big interest and there are various views, that when we initiate certain processes we do it by the book,&#x201D; Frolick said.Political Bureau
