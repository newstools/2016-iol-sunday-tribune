Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s battle against the Gupta family is set to continue after they indicated their intention to challenge his application in court.The family s lawyers said on Saturday they had met the first deadline to give notice of intention to oppose the application, before filing the responding affidavit to Gordhan s.This is expected to be done 15 days after the filing of Gordhan s affidavit, in about two weeks time.The spat between Gordhan and the Guptas will add to the court case the minister is expected to fight with the National Prosecuting Authority after he refused to make representations to its head, Shaun Abrahams.The fight that started with Gordhan revealing what appears to be some of the reasons the four major banks closed their accounts with the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments reached its height this week when Nazeem Howa, Oakbay s chief executive, stepped down.Howa is said to have resigned due to ill health, but the timing of his resignation has raised eyebrows.The affidavit filed by Gordhan in his application for a declaratory order that he is not legally empowered to intervene in their fight against the banks painted Howa in a bad light.It reveals how he persisted with demands for Gordhan to intervene even after the minister had made it clear he could not be party to disputes between a bank and its client.This week saw the Guptas launching a media campaign seeking to clarify some of the transactions cited by Gordhan as having been flagged by the Financial Intelligence Centre as suspicious. The Finance Minister s affidavit noted that opposition to the application requires a written notification with five court days of the affidavit being delivered and within 15 days thereafter to deliver any answering affidavit. Gordhan will this week table his mid-term budget, but has to focus on the multiple legal battles awaiting him.Political Bureau
