Durban - A development by Saantha Naidu, chief executive of Coastlands Hotels and Resorts, and the SNG Group, has joined the list of buildings set to change the uMhlanga skyline. Called The Skye and costing more than R1 billion, it will include luxury drive-up apartments in Ridgeside. Naidu said there was demand for this.Development of phase one should start early next year. The apartments would range from one-bedroom to five-bedroom penthouses with garages and domestic quarters. PGA Architects handled the design. Phase two would include retail and hospitality outlets and an exclusive car showroom for a mix of work, play and shopping. The two phases were to run concurrently. The response to it has been phenomenal and we have received over 100 enquiries from potential buyers and investors. We can now safely say that uMhlanga is becoming the Sandton of Durban, said Naidu.
